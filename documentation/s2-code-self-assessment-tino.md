# Sprint2 Self-Assessment (Tino)
- I created the controllers, routes and schema for the groups. At first I struggled with them, but after revisiting previous backend activities it was fairly straightforward.
- I learned a bit more about how controllers work, and got a better understanding of MongoDB and JWT authentication.
- Our Scrum meetings went well although they were not daily, partly due to conflicting time schedules. So far I do not feel like daily Scrum meetings would have been necessary, but this can be improved especially as we get further in development.
- Next up I will try to implement a few small features to the group controllers, and then implement a file sharing system for the groups.
